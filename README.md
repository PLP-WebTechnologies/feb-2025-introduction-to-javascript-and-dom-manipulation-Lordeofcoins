# DOM Manipulation Project

## Objectives
This project aims to demonstrate basic JavaScript functions for dynamic DOM manipulation. It includes functionalities such as changing text content, modifying CSS styles, and adding or removing elements in response to user interactions.

## Project Structure
```
dom-manipulation-project
├── src
│   ├── index.html       # Well-structured HTML5 document
│   └── script.js        # JavaScript file for DOM manipulation
└── README.md            # Documentation for the project
```

## Instructions
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the project.
2. Interact with the elements on the page to see the dynamic changes made by the JavaScript functions.
3. Review the `script.js` file to understand how the DOM manipulation is implemented.

## Tasks
- Create a well-structured HTML5 document in `index.html` that includes:
  - A header element
  - A paragraph element
  - A button element
  - A section for dynamic content
  - A footer element
- Implement JavaScript functions in `script.js` to:
  - Change the text content of an element
  - Modify the CSS styles of an element
  - Add new elements to the DOM
  - Remove existing elements from the DOM

## Conclusion
This project serves as an introduction to JavaScript and DOM manipulation, providing a foundation for further exploration of web development techniques.
